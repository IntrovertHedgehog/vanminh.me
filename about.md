I am software engineer with severe procrastination syndrome, who also like reading about history of science, graphic novel, and depressing literature. This blog was created for no reason and serves no agenda, purpose, or anyone's benefit. If you're intrigued by any of my writing, it's simply an unfortunate coincidence. It's a delight for me to have you waste your time here.

Here's a picture of the Crab Nebula 'cause it's dope.
