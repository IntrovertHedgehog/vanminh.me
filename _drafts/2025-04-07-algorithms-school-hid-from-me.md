Schools tend to teach you stuff as if they're in a hurry, so if you have enough free time to be reading this article they might not be the best thing in your life, too. Anyway, here's some algorithms either nobody give two shits about, or too complex for a lazy old cog to teach his dumb students. The mechanism by which these are chosen is assumed to be a black box.

### Block Sort: The asymptotically perfect sorting algorithm

```cpp
int main(int argv, char argc []) {
    return 0;
}
```

### Shell Sort: The perfectly mid sorting algorithm

### Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS)

### Viterbi Algorithm

### Some kind of leader election algorithm
